# ChefU
ChefU is a crossplatform (IOS/Android) mobile app that allowed users to create and share recipes. It
included features such as supporting video snippets for each separate step in a recipe as well as custom
built-in timers that were preset in accordance with whatever a recipe demanded. Furthermore, with
accessability in mind, the app also has support for text-to-speech and speech-to-text for the impaired.
